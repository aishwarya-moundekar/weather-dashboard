**Author:** Aishwarya Moundekar  
**Project Type:** Cloud Computing Mini Project  
**Live Demo:** [https://vatavaraan.netlify.app](https://vatavaraan.netlify.app)

---

### 🧭 Overview
**Vatavaraan** (Sanskrit for *atmosphere*) is a **cloud-powered weather intelligence dashboard** that delivers real-time meteorological insights using the **Open-Meteo APIs**.  
Deployed globally via **Netlify**, it demonstrates core **Cloud Computing concepts** such as *API as a Service (AaaS)* and *Platform as a Service (PaaS)*.

### 🔧 Tech Stack
| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-------------|
| **Frontend** | HTML, CSS, JavaScript |
| **Charting Library** | Chart.js |
| **Cloud APIs** | Open-Meteo (Geocoding + Forecast) |
| **Hosting (PaaS)** | Netlify (Static Hosting + Serverless Functions) |

### 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the live URL:  
   👉 [https://vatavaraan.netlify.app](https://vatavaraan.netlify.app)
2. Enter a city (e.g., *Nagpur*, *London*) or coordinates.
3. Click **Get Weather** — real-time data appears instantly.

### 💡 Extensibility
- Add backend (AWS Lambda / Firebase) to log user searches.  
- Integrate richer analytics (Chart.js / D3.js).  
- Implement authentication (Firebase Auth / Cognito).  
- Host on AWS Amplify or Cloudflare Pages for redundancy.  
- Add AI-based predictions (OpenAI / AWS Forecast).

### 🧩 Cloud Concepts Demonstrated
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Hosting via Netlify  
- **API as a Service (AaaS):** Open-Meteo’s real-time APIs  
- **Serverless Architecture:** Stateless, API-driven frontend  
- **Scalability:** CDN-backed global deployment  
- **High Availability:** No backend server dependency
